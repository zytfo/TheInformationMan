/*
This folder contains the Dialogue System's source code.

The Templates folder contains templates that you can use as starting points if you want to write 
your own UI systems or sequencer commands.

You can import "Source Code.unitypackage" to unpack the source code. 

	Notes:

	1. Delete the Assets/DialogueSystem/DLLs folder. Otherwise Unity will complain that two 
	versions of the Dialogue System components exist (the DLL version and the source script
	version), generating several warnings and errors about the scripts being defined multiple
	times.
	
	2. The Dialogue System prefabs reference the components in the DLLs. You will have to
	manually rebuild or relink the prefabs to the source script versions. It may help to have
	two Dialogue System projects open so you can switch between them to see what script each 
	component was originally linked to.
