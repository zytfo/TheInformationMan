Dialogue System Feature Demo

This folder contains a scene that demonstrates the major features of the Dialogue System.
The dialogue was written in Chat Mapper. A subfolder named "Articy Feature Demo" contains
the same demo written in articy:draft.


The Dialogue Database subfolder contains:

- Feature Demo.cmp: The Chat Mapper project
- Feature Demo.xml: The XML exported from the Chat Mapper project
- Feature Demo.asset: The dialogue database converted from the XML


The Articy Feature Demo subfolder contains:

- Articy Feature Demo scene: Feature Demo scene using using articy:draft
- Articy Feature Demo Project.zip: The articy:draft project
- Articy Feature Demo.xml: The XML exported from the articy:draft project
- Feature Demo dialogue database: Generated using the articy:draft Converter tool


The Feature Demo with Continue Button subfolder contains a variation that demonstrates
how to force the player to click a continue button to progress through lines of dialogue.

The Menu Text Demo subfolder contains a variation that uses shorter Menu Text paraphrases for
the player response menu. The player's selection is then expanded into the full Dialogue Text.

The Multiple Database Example subfolder demonstrates how to load and unload additional
dialogue databases at runtime.

The Text Input Example subfolder demonstrates how to prompt the player to type in
text input during conversations.

The Top Down Demo subfolder contains an example using ProximitySelector and NavigateOnMouseClick,
demonstrating methods that could be used for isometric/top-down games.
