/*
This scene is a variation on the Feature Demo that demonstrates how to add and remove
additional dialogue databases. 

You may want to familiarize yourself with the original Feature Demo scene first.
The original uses one database named 'Feature Demo'.

This version uses two databases: 'Dialogue Database 1' and 'Dialogue Database 2'.

'Dialogue Database 2' contains the dialogue database assets for Sergeant Graves (his actor
definition and bark conversation).

'Dialogue Database 1' contains everything else and is the initial database loaded when
the scene starts.

Sergeant Graves has been moved to the far end of the room. A script on a trigger collider
named 'Add Remove DB Trigger' adds his database when entered and removes his database
when exited.
