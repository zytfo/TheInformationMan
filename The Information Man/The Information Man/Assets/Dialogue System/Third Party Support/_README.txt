/*
This folder contains packages that provide support for third party products.

To enable support for a product, import the corresponding package contained
in this folder.

NOTES:
------
- NGUI 2.x support is no longer under development.
- UFPS AI-Addon support is no longer under development.
- Realistic FPS Prefab: If you import Azuline Studios' Realistic FPS Prefab, it will 
change project settings so that the Dialogue System's example script SimpleController.cs 
doesn't register the vertical axis (i.e., run forward and back).
