/*
This folder contains a selection of Unity UI-based dialogue UIs that you can use to set
the Dialogue System's appearance in your project. You can delete any you don't need.

Unity UI requires a Canvas. We recommend adding a Canvas as a child GameObject of the
Dialogue Manager, and then add an instance of one of these prefabs as a child of that
Canvas. Finally, assign that instance to the Dialogue Manager's Dialogue UI field.

These UIs use animations to fade in and out by setting the Canvas Group's Alpha value
from 0 (invisible) to 1 (solid). They start at Alpha value 0 (invisible). To see them
in the editor (for example to customize them), inspect the panel you want to edit and
set the Canvas Group's Alpha to 1.
